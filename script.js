        description: `Hailing from the Spanish mainland is a sound that’s resonating globally thanks to a select choice of producers that have been able to create their own path after years of honest and competent work. A notable character from that sub-culture of game changers is Marc Martinez Nadal, aka AFFKT, who consecrated a music career and has been a driving force behind a vivid & empowering sound that is refined by his drive for perfection. He feels deeply in communion with sounds that range from the most energetic hyper-glossy techno to the most detailed and innovative indie-electronica.

        Having worked on coining the sound of this alias since 2008, it has been a plethora of sound, place, person & culture that has provided a platform for AFFKT to experiment with his output. Both as an experienced music producer of his own projects and as a demanded remixer. Still fresh is the mind-bending rework he made for GusGus’ ‘Simple Tuesday’. And what about those created for the likes of Oliver Koletzki, Fejká, Mason or Bufi to name just a few. Dynamite!
        
        The Valencian has never stopped serving huge electronic crossover masterpieces that derive into the many sub-genres of music via key imprints such as Pets recordings, Multinotes, Mobilee, Last Night On Earth or Stil Vor Talent and his very own Sincopat label, and expressing versatility digging deep into his influences of sounds by delivering heart-stopping, engaging techno on the likes of Octopus, Noir Music, Suara… AFFKT is committed to a life of synthesis and this is what sets himself apart from a comparatively shallow glance at dance music.
        
        Within its versatility is that of working with other musicians. As a result, the fantastic teamwork generated with the vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Sutja Gutierrez. This synergy can be discovered in their just amazing live performances.
        
        Once described as a ‘Son of a Thousand Sounds’ – precisely the title he chose later for his highly acclaimed, even award-winning LP released in 2016. Another remarkable evidence of his talent, creativity and open-mindedness is the ‘The Big Picture’, his latest album to date, a tour de force released on the renowned Mobilee imprint.
        
        AFFKT perfectly manages to thrill us as well as tap into our very core. His music can be enjoyed while dancing, as well as serving as emotional therapy.`

        description: `Brain De Palma is the musical identity of Alexei Versino flowing between the mental “Brain” and the tropical “Palma” realms of electronic music.



First artist to release an album on Peggy Gou’s Gudu Records, Rhythmption LP is his last fatigue. Known also for his project Stump Valle (Dekmantel, Rush Hour, Toy Tonics), he is constantly on the hunt for new musical horizons for his sets.



Born in Ukraine, Alexei’s family chose to leave the area following the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Settling as a child in Turin, the Italian ‘motor city’, Versino was immersed in the local techno movement in his teens as well as many scenes since, navigating Europe for decades, immersed in disparate musical corners, from the squat raves of Bristol to the laid back charm of the Balearics and the cultural contrasts of Egypt.



Following a phase of intense creation during the pandemic lockdown, this forced confinement accelerated a transition to a new electronic identity, one rooted in early musical taste and his inner-child memories. This sonic rebirth manifests as a warm landscape constantly floating through intelligent tech patterns, Latin-inspired rhythms, trance melodies and folk elements.



BDP is a compulsive crate digger and his set owes a debt to decades of music for dancing.

        description: `Italian Dodi Palese is a helpless vinyl addict: if it sounds good, he buys it. Collecting for most of his life, he soaks up anything he can then uses these records to speak to his audience in whatever way suits. Growing up with a father who ran a radio station is what installed this eclectic ethic in him, and it set him in good stead from the off.

        For many years Dodi was core resident at Casablanca (RIP) in Southern Italy, where he would often spread his musical wings through funk, jazz, soul, afro, disco, house and techno for up to eight hours a night. It was an important learning curve that means he is now able to take a dance floor’s hand and lead it on an unpredictable and rewarding journey through sound that defies the usual categorisations.
        
        In the studio, Dodi focusses on following his instincts and getting lost in the moment: he makes music designed for dancing, and music that veers from afro-funky house to deep and supple minimal techno for the late night hours. It is slick, original stuff with real feeling imbued in the compelling grooves. Dodi also curates his own two labels What Ever Not, together with Dan Mela, and Engrave LTD, with Musumeci. They naturally have a broad outlook that takes in raw four-four, afro, electro and techno, and call upon a mix of artists who are well established as well as hot rising stars.`
