Compelled to share his deep passion for electronic music over the past two decades, his unwavering spirit and dedication to nurturing a healthy club culture has led to the formation of a mini empire that includes a successful record label and affiliated events wing; Isolate. As a selector and producer, he has established himself as a highly skilled, intuitive artist who blends emotionally charged atmospheres with deeply hypnotic rhythms and consistently positive energy. A forefather of Turkey’s fertile contemporary electronic music culture, Alican holds a lofty position in his home nation, while maintaining a humble outlook. Almost 20 years since he first became immersed in the scene, he continues to work tirelessly to support the music he loves.

        Modest, grounded and deeply committed to electronic music, Alican is one of the most influential figures in the Turkish electronic music scene, though he would never say that himself. An artist who is constantly seeking out pastures new, renewing himself and driven by unassuming goals, Alican never lets his ego outgrow the music. It’s this authenticity - pure, untainted - that has propelled him to his influential status and earned him universal respect. Still driven by the same genuine energy that spurred him on to experiment with electronic sounds as a teen, Alican continues to stay true to his scene, and himself, with heartfelt commitment…`

Over the years he improved his technique and expanded his musical taste. He was attracted to sounds and melodies deeply rooted in jazz, funky soul and classical music.
        His DJ sets are characterized by several genres. He loves to improvise, but also takes care of the technique and his feeling for music.
        His strong desire to deepen his musical studies led him to attend a course at the „Spazio Musica“ school in 2009. He became a sound engineer and then began his career as a producer.
        In August 2013 the first big success: His track "Love Intro", from his first EP "Groove Family", reached the first place on the Electronica charts of Beatport. In early 2015 his first album "From Daddy's Bag" was released on Overdrive Music.
        
        In July 2015 he released "Vento" on Diynamic Music's VA "Four To The Floor 05". In early 2016 the his first full EP "Essenza EP" was releases on Diynamic with followed by "Artemisia" on FFRR later that year.
        In October 2017 he released his second EP on Diynamic "Midnight Love". In December 2018 "Cuore EP" will be released on Chapter 24 Records and will soon be back on Diynamic with the upcoming release of "Dreams EP".
        
        Looking at his latest productions, it's clear that Andy Bros journey has made him a versatile and complete artist who is not afraid to experiment with different genres to give them their touch.`

        description: `Italian Dodi Palese is a helpless vinyl addict: if it sounds good, he buys it. Collecting for most of his life, he soaks up anything he can then uses these records to speak to his audience in whatever way suits. Growing up with a father who ran a radio station is what installed this eclectic ethic in him, and it set him in good stead from the off.

        For many years Dodi was core resident at Casablanca (RIP) in Southern Italy, where he would often spread his musical wings through funk, jazz, soul, afro, disco, house and techno for up to eight hours a night. It was an important learning curve that means he is now able to take a dance floor’s hand and lead it on an unpredictable and rewarding journey through sound that defies the usual categorisations.
        
        In the studio, Dodi focusses on following his instincts and getting lost in the moment: he makes music designed for dancing, and music that veers from afro-funky house to deep and supple minimal techno for the late night hours. It is slick, original stuff with real feeling imbued in the compelling grooves. Dodi also curates his own two labels What Ever Not, together with Dan Mela, and Engrave LTD, with Musumeci. They naturally have a broad outlook that takes in raw four-four, afro, electro and techno, and call upon a mix of artists who are well established as well as hot rising stars.`

Australian born, Stein first entered the world of art via set design, meticulously crafting event spaces with an eye for the elegant and the mischievous. Moving to New York in 2012, years of developing her unmistakable style as a spatial designer, her skills with composition, color, and ambiance have coagulated into a raw creative force she manipulates into any form she desires.

        A confident performer who has appeared at House of Yes, Mayan Warrior and Cityfox Experience at Brooklyn Mirage, among many other notorious spots, Kate is also carving out her own lane with her productions. Stein channels that force into aggressive rhythms, heavy percussion, and arcane melodies. Releasing her debut Scenic Byway and sophomore Mystic Saddle Ranch EPs in 2021 via Roam Recordings and Playground Records — featuring remixes from the likes of Perel, Zillas On Acid, Balam, and Autarkic — selectors worldwide continue to take notice of Stein's hypnotic pull. July 2022 has her third EP released on TAU, with the Death Stocked EP, her debut with Adana Twins’ label. The EP boasts a bumper selection of reworks from Curses, Zombies in Miami and Leonor.
        
        With audio landscapes meant to inspire joviality and bring about unexpected feelings, this is not the music of pure escapism. This is the music of revelation—opening space within to explore the nebulous reaches of yourself.
        
        In the eyes and ears of Stein, these sounds paint the pictures of New York City's bustling streets and the outlying deserts around Los Angeles, the two metropolises she currently calls home. Within these concrete jungles laid opposite one another, every environment which Stein wishes
        to fill with pulsating frequencies exists. Pop-ups. Niche festivals. Places where someone can fully express their inner-child.
        
        With Kate Stein as a guide, you won't just hear that inimitable contrast. Instead, it will appear before your very eyes and envelop your whole body. Keep an eye on this rocket: with a few more releases to come in 2023, her dynamic and fun approach to dance floor soundscapes is in full bloom.`
